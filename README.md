# K-Means
This project focuses on implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm entirely from scratch using Numpy, without relying on high level machine learning libraries for the core logic.A synthetic multi model  dataset with well-separated clusters  is generated to validate the implementation. The performance of the custom K-Means alogorithm is evaluated using Inertia  (Within-cluster sum of squares,WCSS) and compared against scikit-learns standard K-Meands implementation.Finally PCA is used to visualize the clustering results in two dimensions.
